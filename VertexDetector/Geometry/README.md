README FILE for /VertexDetector/Geometry

#### Detector.h
- defines a **namespace** (**detector**) containing geometrical parameters and properties of the detector
  - thickness and radius of beam pipe (BP)
  - thickness and radius of 1st layer (1L) and 2nd layer (2L) of the barrel detector
  - detector's length
  - acceptance
  - smearing
  - *cutPhi* : max azimutal distance between two hits so that they can be considered as generated by the same particle 
  - *thetaSpace* : RMS of the gaussian distribution of deviation angle in multiple scattering
  
  
#### VertexResolution.h
- defines a **namespace** (**vres**) containing the RMS of the generated vertex coordinates' gaussian distributions
