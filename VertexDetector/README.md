## README FILE for /VertexDetector

The folder ~/VertexDetector contains a **simulation and reconstruction** program for a vertex detector.
The **authors** are Arianna Corrado and Lorenzo de Cilladi.
The program was written as exam project for the course "Tecniche di Analisi Numerica e Simulazione" ("Numerical Analysis and Simulation Technology"), held by Professor Massimo Masera).

The Simulation is in the folder ~/VertexDetector/Sim/

The Reconsruction code is in the folder ~/VertexDetector/Reco/

The scripts for the output's analysis are in ~/VertexDetector/Analysis/

Some geometrical features of the detector and a few utils can be found in ~VertexDetector/Geometry/ and ~VertexDetector/Utils/

Each one of the above-mentioned folders contains a **README** file, which guides the user through the usage and the understanding of scripts and files found in the folders.

Both the simulation and the reconstruction programs are object-oriented. The header files for the classes are grouped in the folders ~/Sim/include/ and ~/Reco/include/; the implementation files can be found in ~/Sim/src/ and ~/Reco/src/.
The documentation of the classes can be accessed opening the file ~/docs/index.html through a browser, e.g.
```
~/OldSovietSchool/VertexDetector/docs$ firefox index.html
```
In the html documentation, above-mentioned README files for Sim, Reco and Analysis can also be accessed.
